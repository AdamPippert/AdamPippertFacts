# AdamPippertFacts

This is a super basic Alexa skill designed to return information about yours truly.  To activate, add the fact to your Alexa account, then say "<invocation word>, tell Adam Pippert Facts to give me a fact".  You will be blown away by some of the things you learn about me.  Actually, that's probably not true, but you'll probably know more about me than you would if you hadn't activated the fact, and that counts for something.
  
  This code is mostly based on the Alexa fact tutorial on AWS.  Having said that, see LICENSE.md for more details.
